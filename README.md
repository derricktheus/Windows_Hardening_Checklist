# Windows Hardening Checklist

I put this together while practicing baseline Windows hardening. I automated checks with PowerShell and documented the steps I followed so I could rerun them later.

**Contents**
- `windows_hardening.ps1` — script with checks I wrote (firewall, SMBv1, RDP, BitLocker, updates, TLS)
- `hardening_checklist.md` — the manual+automated steps I walked through

## Future Improvements
- Add TLS/SSL checks
- Expand event log auditing
